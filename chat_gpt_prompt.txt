#ChatGPT Prompt:

I have a dataset that is stored in the file "spy.csv", which has the following columns: date,price,per_chg_from_day_prior

Now, using this dataset, I need code that will (1) load in the dataset as a tibble, (2) write code that will generate a histogram in ggplot2 using 100 breaks as well as compute the 5th and 95th percentiles create a new column called "event_type" that will fill in a value of -1 if the return is in the lower 5th percentile, 0 if it is in between the 5th and 95th percentiles, and 1 if it is in the 95th percentile, and in addition, will create a new column called "days_since_last_positive" and "days_since_last_negative", which will be the number of observations in between the current obervation and the last observation that had a value of 1 (for "days_since_last_positive") or -1 (for "days_since_last_negative"), (3) (a) filter out the observations where "event_type" is equal 1 and draw a histogram of the values "days_since_last_positive" and (b) filter out the observations where "event_type" is equal to -1 and draw a histogram of the vsalues "days_since_last_negative" and (4) explore the relationship, using ggplot2 scatter plots, between the lagged positive time differences and negative time differences.  Please fill the code into each of the following sections:


# (1) Intro: Load in the dataset

# (2) Finding the "Cut-Off" Points that Define the "Event Periods"

# (3) Distribution of Time Differences (+/-) Between Events

# (4) Relationship Between Previous # of Days (+/-) and Current # of Days

I have the following dataset, which has the date, the price of the SPY, 
the percentage change from the prior day, a column called "id" which uniquely
identifies the observation day, and the "event_type", which tells us if the day
closed normal (0), abnormally low (-1), or abnormally high (1):

I would like to create two new columns.  First column is to be called num_obs_since_last_neg,
and the value for each row is found as follows:  For a given row, it takes the current value of id 
and subtracts from it the highest value of id, up to that row,  whose corresponding row had a value of -1.  To compute the second column,
called num_obs_since_last_pos, for a given row, it takes the current value of id 
and subtracts from it the highest value of id, up to that row, whose corresponding row had a value of 1.  So, the final dataset should look like this:

> head(spy_data,20)
# A tibble: 20 × 5
   date       price per_chg_from_day_prior    id event_type num_obs_since_last_neg num_obs_since_last_pos
